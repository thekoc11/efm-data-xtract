# `efm-data-xtract`: A Data Extractor for the Early Fusion Music Project

This extractor can parse Carnatic compositions in any text format, and extract notations from music audio source(s) in a 12-tonal numerical format. [My Fork of FFMPEG](https://github.com/thekoc11/FFmpeg) will allow you to view the extracted notations as a video.  

For parsing text notations, please remember to add the `<BEGIN>` and the `<END>` tags in the text file, the former a line before the desired location for beginning the parse and the latter a line after the desired location of ending the parse.
